# ATL playbooks

Choose one primary playbook. Each line is a gateable phase, not permission to run the whole chain without returning artifacts.

## Investigation

Scope question → inspect primary evidence → test competing explanations → cited answer → residual uncertainty.

## Bug fix

Frame symptom → reproduce on the real surface → isolate root cause → specify regression behavior → smallest repair → regression and broader checks → verdict.

## Performance

Define metric/load/environment → baseline → locate bottleneck → one falsifiable change → controlled comparison → explain the number → rollback/verdict.

## Feature

Bound outcome → domain/behavior spec → impact plan → documentation-impact check → vertical slices with feedback → acceptance observation → evidence packet. Route docs work to `$atl-tech-docs` when available.

## Refactor

Pin preserved behavior → map callers and boundaries → establish characterization evidence → change in verifiable units → compare behavior → audit scope.

## Architecture decision

Name forces and constraints → decide whether the choice warrants an ADR → explore materially different designs → test risky premises with prototypes/research → record decision, alternatives, consequences, lifecycle, and fitness evidence → plan only after intent approval. Route the record to `$atl-adr` when available; otherwise use the native decision record fallback.

## Large or multi-session program

Name destination → map decisions and dependencies → expose ready frontier → assign isolated ownership → integrate through explicit contracts → independent evidence at every boundary. Use coordination only when isolation and merge ownership are real.

## Review

Pin exact subject → inspect actual diff → review spec fidelity and project standards separately → analyze downstream impact → run risk-matched checks → conditional verdict with owners.

## UI review and repair

Pin audience, task, design authority, supported surfaces, and repair authority → run the real interface → inspect representative viewports, input methods, and states → assess intent, visual system, interaction, responsiveness, accessibility, runtime, and consistency as separate axes → prioritize findings by user impact → make the smallest authorized fix at the responsible layer → re-observe the same condition and adjacent regressions → scoped verdict with unobserved areas explicit. Route to `$atl-ui-review` when available.

## Delivery

Confirm approved intent → verify contiguous change set → inspect documentation impact → inspect CI and operational gates → confirm rollback/containment → human approval for merge/deploy/publish → record outcome.

## Skill or workflow authoring

Define trigger and exclusion → identify decision-changing guidance → keep entry metadata discriminating → move conditional depth to references → validate structure → forward-test on realistic positive and negative prompts.

## Routing handoff

Every routed specialist must return a named artifact: frame/brief, observable spec, impact plan, implementation diff, evidence packet, review findings, audit verdict, or delivery record. ATL checks that artifact against the next playbook's entry condition before continuing. If the artifact is missing, contradictory, or based only on an unverified claim, stop at the current gate and report the next safe action.
